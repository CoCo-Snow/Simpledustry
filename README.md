This Mod is in early-development and removes details from the vanilla textures of Mindustry!
There are still a lot of textures missing and some might aren't working but I will fix these problems step-by-step.
All textures were made by Yoru Kitsune.

If you want to help making this big mod, please read the [Contibuting](https://github.com/Yoru-Kitsune/Simpledustry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) page.

If you want the UI elements made for this mod too, download the [ui-pack](https://github.com/Yoru-Kitsune/Simpledustry-ui-pack).

All textures redesigned or added after the 16th of july 2023 have fixed shading. Small detail that makes it a bit more vanilla-like.

(Currently the V2 is actively being worked on with many new and remade textures for better understanding and less rushed textures)

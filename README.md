This Mod is in early-development and removes details from the vanilla textures of Mindustry!
There are still a lot of textures missing and some might aren't working but I will fix these problems step-by-step.
All textures are made by 夜狐 (Yoru Kitsune).

This mod was inspired by the Simplistic - Texturepack by EchoVespy, who unfortunatly stopped working on it.
I got some bugs of the Simplistic mod fixed and I try to extend the mod, by completly redesigning the sprites.
If there are sprites in this mod that look the exact same in the Simplistic mod, I didn't steal them... we just have the same goal and the same base textures.
